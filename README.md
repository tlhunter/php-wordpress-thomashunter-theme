# ThomasHunter.Name Wordpress Theme

This is my custom wordpress theme that I will be using for http://thomashunter.name.
It is heavily influenced by a common OS X GUI pattern, used by such applications as
Sparrow and Twitter.

This theme is based on Bones (http://themble.com/bones/), and the icons are from
GentleFace (http://www.gentleface.com/free_icon_set.html).

# Wordpress Settings

* Disable emoticons
* Disable toolbar
* Homepage listing of last X blogposts

# Pitfalls

A lot of things are hard coded right now (e.g. navigations). It would be kickass if
someone knows a lot about wordpress themes and wants to send pull requests to make
this thing more customizable, but I don't have much motivation for that.

# License

* Wordpress is owned by Wordpress.
* Bones is owned by Themble.
* Icons are owned by GentleFace.
* Not sure who owns the GUI pattern.
* I wrote some CSS and edited some PHP, I guess I'll MIT that part.
