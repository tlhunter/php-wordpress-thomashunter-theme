# ThomasHunter.Name Wordpress Theme

This is my custom wordpress theme that I will be using for http://thomashunter.name.
It is heavily influenced by a common OS X GUI pattern, used by such applications as
Sparrow and Twitter.

This theme is based on Bones (http://themble.com/bones/), and the icons are from
GentleFace (http://www.gentleface.com/free_icon_set.html).

Wordpress is owned by Wordpress.
Bones is owned by Themble.
Icons are owned by GentleFace.
Not sure who owns the GUI pattern.
I wrote some CSS and edited some PHP, I guess I'll MIT that part.
